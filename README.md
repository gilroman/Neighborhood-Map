# Neighborhood-Map
My implementation of the Neighborhood-Map Project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree.

## Silverlake, Los Angeles
My chosen neighborhood is Silverlake in Los Angeles

### Searching
You can search by business name or by type of business activity (ie. restaurant, yoga, walk, etc...)

### Viewing Business Information
Simply click on a marker on the map or on the name of the location on the list to view location details such as address, 
url or phone number and the first 3 tips provided by users of Foursquare.

Enjoy!

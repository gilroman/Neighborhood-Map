# Neighborhood-Map
My implementation of the Neighborhood-Map Project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree.

The listings in this neighborhood map are in Silverlake, Los Angeles.

## Getting started

These instructions will allow you to run the neighborhood map in your own computer.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and your preferred web browser.

### Instructions

1. Clone or download the Neighborhood-Map repository.

2. Open the command line Terminal for your computer.

3. Navigate to the location of the Neighborhood map and run the command **npm install**
This will install the Express dependency for this project on a folder named node_modules
under the same folder as the Neighborhood Map.
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

4. On the terminal prompt type the command **node server.js**
This will launch a local node server on your computer listening on port 8080

5. On your web browser type in the url **http://localhost:8080/index.html**
You should now be seing the website

6. To close the server with the terminal window active press the keys **control+c** together at the same time.


## Usage
You can search listings by business name or by type of business activity (ie. restaurant, yoga, walk, etc...).

When you click on a listing or on a marker on the map and infowindow will open giving additional information location details such as address, url or phone number and the first 3 tips provided by users of Foursquare.
